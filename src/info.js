        <p>
          I didn‚Äôt start out planning to become a <span>developer</span>. I just loved
          figuring things out ‚Äî fixing broken things, trying out ideas, and learning
          by building. That curiosity naturally grew into a habit of picking up
          <span> new skills</span> and using them to create.
          <br />
          <br />
          One of my early projects was a <span>Hospital Management System</span>, built using 
          <span>PHP</span> and <span>MySQL</span> to handle <span>appointments</span>, 
          <span>patient data</span>, and <span>staff coordination</span>. I then created a 
          <span>face recognition-based attendance system</span> that marks attendance 
          using <span>real-time webcam input</span> and <span>facial encodings</span>, 
          helping prevent <span>proxy attendance</span>.
          <br />
          <br />
          Later, I built <span>AVA</span>, a desktop assistant that automates daily tasks 
          like <span>sending messages</span>, <span>launching apps</span>, and even 
          <span>object detection</span> ‚Äî combining <span>AI</span>, <span>voice interaction</span>, 
          and <span>automation</span>. I also explored <span>hardware</span> through a 
          <span>touchless sanitizer dispenser</span> using <span>Arduino</span> and 
          <span>sensors</span> during the COVID period.
          <br />
          <br />
          These projects helped me explore <span>AI</span>, <span>IoT</span>, 
          <span>web development</span>, and <span>automation</span>. They‚Äôve shown me how to turn 
          simple ideas into <span>real-world tools</span> with practical impact.
